## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learnt how to use the flexbox in CSS from this project and using a diffrent font style in html head.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
   body{
    background-color: hsl(212,45%, 89%);
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development
I want to continue focusing on using css flex in future projects.. Not so clear on it yet. I am still not comfortable with using the column or rows. Totally confused in that part. I would also want to be perfect in using the display function.Dont know when it should be flex, absolute, fixed etc.
